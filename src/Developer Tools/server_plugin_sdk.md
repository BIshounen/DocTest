### Video Source SDK

The Video Source Integration SDK enables easy integration of any video source (live or archived) into the system. With the SDK, it's possible to create a method for discovering, displaying, analyzing, and recording video from virtually any live or recorded video source - IP Cameras, encoders, NVR's, DVR's, and more. It also allows for the integration of device I/O's (inputs & outputs) and motion detection metadata.

### Storage SDK

The Storage SDK enables easy integration of any potential storage. Using the Storage SDK developers can read from or write to any storage location - locally available, remote storage, and even cloud servers. Creating a storage plugin requires implementing standard functions such as I/O stream, if files exist, delete files, list of files in the folder, etc. The Storage SDK also contains an example of using an FTP server as a storage location.
