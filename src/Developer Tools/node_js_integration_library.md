## Node.js Integration Library

### What is the Nx Meta VMP Open Integrations repository?

It is an open-source repository called "nx_open_integrations" which contains **Network Optix Meta Video Management Platform open-source integration examples** â€” the source code and specifications that show how to integrate a third-party solution with Nx Meta and thus all Powered-By-Nx products, including Nx Meta. This is useful for the rapid development of middleware to connect different systems together or to add custom web pages to the systems.

This repository uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as its version control system. Most of the source code and other files are licensed under the terms of [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/) (unless specified otherwise in the files) which can be found in the license_mpl2.md file in the root directory of the repository.

### What is the Nx Node.js integration?

The Node.js integration is a framework that allows developers and integrators to quickly and easily make integrations with Nx Meta Server using server-side javascript. This is the first integration example available in our open-source repository for you to utilize, but be sure to keep an eye out for more additions in the near future.
